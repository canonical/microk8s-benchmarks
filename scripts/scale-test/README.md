# Scale testing
The aim of the scale testing benchmark is to establish a way to test, measure and validate the improvements implemented on microk8s.

Moreover this evaluation at scale can be used to communicate the exact performance achieved to customers and interested partners.

## Running the benchmark

### 1. vSphere setup
Currently, we are running it in vSphere/Boston cluster. You will need credentials to access it. Simply run:

```bash
./scripts/setup-vsphere.sh
```

and it will bootstrap a juju controller on a vSphere cloud, ready to deploy any charm!

You can specify `VS_USER`, `VS_PASS` and `VS_CONTROLLER` environment variables for a non-interactive install:

```bash
VS_USER="foo" VS_PASS="bar" VS_CONTROLLER="mycontroller" ./scripts/setup-vsphere.sh 
```

### 2. Microk8s cluster
Once a juju controller has been setup, you can use the `setup_cluster.py` script to create a Microk8s cluster on a new juju model. By default, it will create a single-node cluster on the `microk8s` namespace. However:

```bash
python scripts/scale-test/setup_cluster.py -m "mycluster" --nodes 10 --control-plane 3
```

will create a new juju model named `mycluster`, spin up 10 ubuntu instances on it and install `microk8s`. After that, it will join nodes as workers or not depending on the number of control-plane nodes were specified. You can also specify which channel you want to install by using the `--channel` argument.

Check out `python setup_cluster.py --help` for more detailed instructions on how to use the tool.

#### Docker credentials
If you are trying to setup a large cluster, you will most probably hit dockerhub rate-limit errors (see [this documentation page](https://microk8s.io/docs/dockerhub-limits)).

To workaround this, you can specify the docker login credentials with

```bash
python setup_cluter.py --docker-username foo --docker-password bar
```

or with env variables

```bash
export DOCKER_USERNAME="foo"
export DOCKER_PASSWORD="bar"
python setup_cluter.py
```

and containerd on all nodes will be configured accordingly.

#### HTTP proxy settings
If you are running this script on a network-restricted environment (like vSphere cluster), you may need to specify the http proxy to configure the nodes. You can do so with the `--http-proxy` argument:

```bash
python setup_cluster.py --http-proxy http://squid.internal:3128
```

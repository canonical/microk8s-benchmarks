# microk8s-benchmarks
Data and tooling for microk8s benchmarklib.

The `data/` folder is the data lake where all the experiment's output is stored. The `reports/` folder is where the final reports should be stored. Finally, the `scripts/` holds all the scripts and tooling needed to run each benchmark.

You can read more on each individual benchmark by checking out the README.md file inside each benchmark folder (e.g: `scripts/scale-test/README.md`).
